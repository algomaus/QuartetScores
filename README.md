The command line options of the program are:

    ./QuartetScores  [-s] [-v] [-t <number>] -r <file_path> -e <file_path> -o <file_path> [--version] [-h]

Where:

`-r <file_path>`,  `--ref <file_path>`: (required)  Path to the reference tree

`-e <file_path>`,  `--eval <file_path>`: (required)  Path to the evaluation trees

`-o <file_path>`,  `--output <file_path>`: (required)  Path to the output file
